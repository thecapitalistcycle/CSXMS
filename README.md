# Communicating Stream X-Machine System (CSXMS)


This repo is for notes while studying technologies relevant to implementing Agent Based Models (ABM) using a CSXMS generator, FLAME GPU (FGPU) and its predecessor, FLAME-HPC (FHPC). References to FLAME are about both or a future combination that works with High Performance Computing (HPC) grid clusters of GPUs or Wide Area Networks of individual gamer PCs with GPUs.

No actual development work will be done here. The aim is for notes while studying to understand enough to be able to do ABM models for microfoundations of Maksakovsky's macro model in "The Capitalist Cycle".

Current focus will be on relevance of FLAME GPU to modelling covid-19 transmission in current pandemic, with no direct relevance to economic modelling. Other repos relevant to covid-19 have been forked here for study.

CSXMS looks highly relevant to pandemic modelling. Understanding the relevant technology with that focus will eventually be useful for economic modelling. Meanwhile it could hopefully contribute to documentation of FLAME GPU and its relevance to current pandemic.

Comments and edits very welcome by raising an Issue or a Pull Request.
